# during PHY initialization and autonegotiation. Also only constantly read
# link status if not interrupts are supported by the PHY.

# support interrupts!).
phy_device.c.patch

# RATE_FASTMODE. Custom baudrate is not supported.
# Fixes bug #9116.
i2c_rate_normal.patch

# Changed localversion to _stm_XXXX
# Keep this format for new kernel releases since
# STSEC drivers are depented on this.
localversion.patch

# Vip19x3 (with NXP chip for HDMI) needs an additional
# delay (approx. one I2C clock-period) between the ACKs and the
# bytes in multi-byte transfers over I2C to end up with the same
# timing as Vip19x0. This is probably explained by faster IRQ handling,
# but can also be related to how the NXP chip converts SDA/SCL on the DDC-pins.
# See bug #11550
delayed_i2c_read.patch

# This patch adds a fix for i2c no-stop read/writes
# to the bit-banging driver.

# Update from Peppe Cavallaro:
# ---------------------
# with the patch applied the network seems to be more stable and the I can
# work without any problems with the Half Duplex Link. Indeed, I was able
# to reproduce the problem with the original Kernel on this VIP1903.
# You will find more details within the patch itself.

# listening configurable in runtime. Some (faulty) igmp equipment does not
# work if this hack is not enabled...
