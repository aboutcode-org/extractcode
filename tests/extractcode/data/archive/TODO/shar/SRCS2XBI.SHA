#! /bin/sh
# Shellscript for xbin'ing groups of files to one directory for macput.
# Invokes /bin/sh upon entry.
# 
# This shellscript will ignore directories and files that are unreadable,
# 	as well as any files without the line "(This file must be converted...)"
#
# Wildcards may be used.  Thus, to xbin all files in the range 240 to 249
#	use "macxbin 24*"
# Upon termination of the operation, the Macintosh bell will ring
#	two times.  This is your clue to wake up and see what is waiting.
# 	This might be deleted if you plan to do this in the background and 
#	don't want to be bothered.
